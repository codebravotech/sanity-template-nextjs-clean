# Clean Next.js + Sanity app

This is a BRANCH of a FORK of the [NextJS + Sanity Starter Template](https://github.com/sanity-io/sanity-template-nextjs-clean) with some extra functionality for Enterprise demos: 
- more types of page blocks (contact form, announcments list, full width video, etc)
- support for video in Media Library+ with Mux


Please do NOT merge this branch to the main of the fork (which is used for working on PRs to the core upstream repo) or to that upstream repo itself -- just clone and run/deploy from the branch.
